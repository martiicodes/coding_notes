# Quicksort

You learn about **divide-and-conquer**.

Divide-and-conquer is the first general technique you learn.

You learn about quicksort, an elegant sorting algorithm that’s often used in practice. Quicksort uses divide-and-conquer.

We’ll explore divide and conquer (D&C), a well-known recursive technique for solving problems.

D&C gives you a new way to think about solving problems.

When you get a new problem, you don’t have to be stumped. Instead, you can ask, “Can I solve this if I use divide and conquer?”

You’ll learn your first major D&C algorithm: **quicksort**. 
*Quicksort* is a sorting algorithm, and a much faster one than *selection sort*.

## Divide & conquer

Use the D&C strategy! D&C algorithms are recursive algorithms.

To solve a problem using D&C, there are two steps:

1. Figure out the base case. This should be the simplest possible case.
2. Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case.

According to D&C, with every recursive call, you have to reduce your problem.

To recap, here’s how D&C works:

1. Figure out a simple case as the base case.
2. Figure out how to reduce your problem and get to the base case.

D&C isn’t a simple algorithm that you can apply to a problem. Instead,
it’s a way to think about a problem.

### Sneak peak at functional programming

“Why would I do this recursively if I can do it easily with a loop?” you
may be thinking. Well, this is a sneak peek into functional programming!
Functional programming languages like *Haskell* don’t have loops, so
you have to use recursion to write functions like this. If you have a good
understanding of recursion, functional languages will be easier to learn.
