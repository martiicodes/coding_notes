# One of the simplest and most illustrative examples of recursion is the calculation of the factorial of a number. 
# Hereâ€™s a Python function that demonstrates this:

def factorial(n):
    # Base case: if n is 0, return 1
    
    # This is the condition that stops the recursion. 
    # If n is 0, the function returns 1 because the factorial of 0 is defined as 1.
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    # Recursive case: n * factorial of (n-1)

    # Here, the function calls itself with the argument n - 1. This process repeats, 
    # reducing the value of n each time, until it reaches the base case.
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Test the function

# When you call factorial(5), it will recursively call itself until it reaches factorial(0), 
# then multiply the results as it unwinds the recursion stack.
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
